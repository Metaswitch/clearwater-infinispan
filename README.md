# Clearwater Infinispan

This repository contains Debian package build tools for [Infinispan](http://www.jboss.org/infinispan), an extremely scalable, highly available key/value NoSQL datastore.  Clearwater's [sprout](https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout) component uses Infinispan for its registration store.
